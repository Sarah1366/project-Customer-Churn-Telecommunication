**Introduction**

This analysis focuses on the behaviour of telecom customers who are more likely to leave the platform. I intend to find out the most striking behaviour of customers through EDA and later on use some of predictive analytics technique to determine the customer who are most likely to churn. Customer churn Analysis is a critical component of any business plan in all stages of growth where data about customer behaviour is used to help business to make decision via predictive analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to have a better understanding in customer behaviour and predict behaviour to retain customers.
 Our categorical target variable Churn is most commonly expressed as the percentage (or number) of service subscribers who discontinue doing business or end relationship with a company. For predictive analysis we use classification technique this dataset with  tree types of different machine learning such as Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and SVM in order to conduct accuracy to determine which model is the best at identifying relationships and patterns between variables in a dataset.. <br />

•       Who (Describe) are our clients? <br />
•       How is our services distribution? Diagnostic Analysis <br />
•       What factors are influencing churn? Predictive Analysis<br />
